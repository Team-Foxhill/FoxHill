    StartDialogue: 'Oh my, these days Eouduksini are appearing in droves.

      It''s
      quite peculiar, don''t you think?

      I''d like to investigate this phenomenon.

      Would
      you be so kind as to catch ten of them for me?'
    ProgressDialogue: 'Ten Eouduksini, that''s all I need.

      It shouldn''t be
      too taxing, eh?

      I''m counting on you, dear.'
    SuccessDialogue: 'Oh my, so Eouduksini multiply without growing larger...

      What
      a curious phenomenon indeed.

      It seems some divine power is keeping the
      darkness at bay.

      Thanks to that, we can hold out for now.

      I do
      pray they retreat before that power wanes, yes I do.'
    FailDialogue: 'Oh dear, I never imagined

      your skills would be this lacking.

      But
      what can we do, eh?

      From now on, you''ll just have to train harder,
      won''t you?

      Here, I''ll share some of my power with you.

      Focus
      on your training, there''s a good lad.'

    StartDialogue: 'I hate to trouble you again, my dear,

      but could you deliver
      this talisman paper to my younger sibling?

      I''m terribly worried with
      all these Eouduksini appearing lately.

      You see, this talisman paper
      loses its efficacy if it gets too old.

      That''s why I need your help.

      You
      Dosa know the art of space folding, don''t you?

      If you''re not quite
      sure what I mean,

      just imagine the Chinese character for ''go'' (Z)
      in your mind.

      If that wish reaches the Jade Emperor beyond our mortal
      realm,

      he''ll grant you the power to traverse great distances in an
      instant.

      So, please, deliver this talisman paper with haste.

      My
      sibling has gone to gather wood.

      I''m counting on you, alright?'
    ProgressDialogue: 'My sibling''s gather wood, remember?

      Don''t dilly-dally
      now.

      Draw that ''go''(z) character in your mind.

      Oh Jade Emperor,
      we humbly beseech you...'
    SuccessDialogue: 'Older brother sent you, did he? Ha ha!

      he worries far
      too much, bless his soul.

      I''m doing just fine, but I can''t send you
      back empty-handed

      after you''ve done us a favor.

      Take this restorative
      broth. It''s my secret

      to being able to gather wood all day long.

      Give
      it a try when you get the chance.'
    FailDialogue: 'Oh dear me, didn''t I mention the talisman paper

      become
      loses its efficacy if it gets too old?

      I never thought you''d disappoint
      an old soul like this.'
